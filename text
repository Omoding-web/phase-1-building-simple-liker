Add the .hidden class to the error modal in the HTML:

This is done at the beginning with errorModal.classList.add('hidden');. The modal will be hidden initially.
When a user clicks on an empty heart:

You use mimicServerCall to simulate a server request.
When the "server" returns a failure status:

You handle this case with the .catch(() => {}) block.
The error modal is displayed by removing the .hidden class.
The error message is set and displayed in the modal.
The modal is hidden after 3 seconds using setTimeout.
When the "server" returns a success status:

You handle this case with the .then(() => {}) block.
The heart is changed to a full heart.
The .activated-heart class is added to make the heart appear red.
When a user clicks on a full heart:

This is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code, but based on your existing logic, it seems that clicking on a full heart will revert it back to an empty heart and remove the .activated-heart class.
Keep all styling rules entirely in style.css:

The code doesn't directly manipulate the style properties. All styling is expected to be in the style.css file.
Only manipulate the DOM once the server request responds:

The code manipulates the DOM inside the .then(() => {}) and .catch(() => {}) blocks, ensuring that the DOM manipulation occurs only after the server request responds.
Check if the modal has the 'hidden' class:

This check is done at the end with expect(errorModal.classList.contains('hidden')).toBe(true);. It verifies that the error modal is initially hidden.
Additional async function for waiting for DOMContentLoaded:

You have an async function waitForDOMContentLoaded that wraps the test and uses await to wait for the DOM to be fully loaded.
